    title: "Handling of Applications Under Secrecy Order",
    content:
      "Applications that are subject to a secrecy order under 35 U.S.C. 181 require special handling procedures to ensure that classified or sensitive subject matter is properly protected throughout the prosecution process. The Licensing and Review section of the USPTO is the primary organizational unit responsible for administering and overseeing applications under secrecy orders. Licensing and Review coordinates with the interested Government agencies that requested the secrecy order, manages the flow of classified documents within the Office, and ensures that all personnel who handle the application have the requisite security clearances. Applications under secrecy order are physically segregated from the general patent application files and are stored in secure facilities that meet the security requirements corresponding to the classification level of the application. The classification level assigned to an application determines the specific handling, storage, transmission, and destruction requirements that must be followed. All correspondence related to a secrecy order application, including office actions, amendments, and other prosecution documents, must be transmitted through secure channels. The applicant and the applicant's registered practitioner must also follow strict procedures when handling classified application materials, including using approved mailing methods, maintaining secure storage, and limiting access to authorized individuals. The USPTO issues specific instructions to applicants and practitioners regarding these procedures when a secrecy order is imposed. Failure to comply with the prescribed handling procedures may result in adverse security consequences and potential disciplinary action.",

    title: "Security Marking Categories and Handling",
    content:
      "Applications under secrecy order may be assigned different security classification levels, each carrying its own set of handling requirements. The primary classification levels used in the U.S. Government classification system are Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. A Confidential classification is assigned to information whose unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security. A Secret classification is assigned when unauthorized disclosure could be expected to cause serious damage to national security. A Top Secret classification is assigned when unauthorized disclosure could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security. In addition to these classification levels, certain applications may carry special access program (SAP) markings or Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) designations, which impose additional access restrictions beyond the base classification level. The Licensing and Review section of the USPTO is responsible for ensuring that each application under secrecy order is handled in accordance with the requirements corresponding to its assigned classification level. This includes ensuring that the application file is stored in an approved security container, that all copies of the application documents are accounted for and properly marked, and that access to the application is restricted to individuals who hold the appropriate security clearance and have a demonstrated need-to-know. When transmitting classified application materials, the USPTO and applicants must use methods approved for the classification level involved, such as registered mail, approved courier services, or secure electronic transmission systems. Classified documents must be properly marked with their classification level on every page.",

    title: "Practitioner Obligations and Clearance",
    content:
      "Patent practitioners who represent applicants in matters involving applications under secrecy order have specific obligations regarding the handling of classified information. Before a practitioner can access classified application materials, the practitioner must possess a valid security clearance at or above the classification level of the application. Security clearances are granted by the appropriate Government agency after a thorough background investigation. The USPTO coordinates with the relevant agency to verify that a practitioner holds the requisite clearance before granting access to classified application files. Practitioners who hold security clearances are bound by the terms of their clearance agreement, which typically includes obligations regarding the proper storage, handling, and transmission of classified materials. Classified application documents must be stored in approved security containers, such as GSA-approved safes or vaults, when not in active use. Practitioners may not discuss classified subject matter in unsecured locations or over unsecured communication channels, including standard telephone lines, email, or fax. The practitioner must maintain a log of all classified documents in their possession and must be prepared to account for each document upon request. When classified documents are no longer needed, they must be destroyed using approved methods, such as cross-cut shredding or burning, and the destruction must be documented. Practitioners who do not hold the appropriate security clearance may still represent clients in secrecy order matters but are limited to handling unclassified aspects of the prosecution, such as filing administrative documents that do not contain classified information. Any breach of security obligations may result in revocation of the practitioner's security clearance, referral to the Office of Enrollment and Discipline, and potential criminal prosecution under applicable statutes.",
