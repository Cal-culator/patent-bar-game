    title: "Secrecy Orders",
    content:
      "Under 35 U.S.C. 181, whenever the publication or disclosure of an invention by the publication of an application or by the granting of a patent is, in the opinion of the head of an interested Government agency, detrimental to the national security, the Commissioner for Patents shall order that the invention be kept secret and shall withhold the publication of the application or the grant of a patent. The secrecy order system is a critical mechanism by which the United States Government prevents the disclosure of inventions that could harm national defense or security interests. When a patent application is filed at the USPTO, it is screened by defense agencies to determine whether the subject matter warrants classification or restricted disclosure. If the screening reveals potentially sensitive subject matter, the head of the interested Government agency notifies the Commissioner, who then issues a secrecy order under 35 U.S.C. 181. The issuance of a secrecy order has significant consequences for the applicant: the application will not be published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b), no patent will be granted, and the applicant is prohibited from disclosing the invention as specified in the order. Importantly, under 37 C.F.R. 5.2, the imposition of a secrecy order also operates to revoke any foreign filing license that may have been previously granted for the application. The applicant must strictly comply with the terms of the secrecy order until it is rescinded or expires. Violations may result in abandonment of the application under 35 U.S.C. 182 and potential criminal penalties under 35 U.S.C. 186.",

    title: "Imposition of Secrecy Orders Under 35 USC 181",
    content:
      "The process for imposing a secrecy order begins with the screening of newly filed patent applications by defense agencies. When a patent application is filed at the USPTO, the application is reviewed to determine whether its subject matter may implicate national security. The defense agencies most commonly involved in this screening process include the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Each agency reviews applications that fall within its area of expertise and interest. If an agency determines that disclosure of the invention would be detrimental to national security, the head of that agency notifies the Commissioner for Patents, who then issues a secrecy order under 35 U.S.C. 181. The secrecy order is typically communicated to the applicant by the Licensing and Review section of the USPTO. The order specifies the restrictions placed on the applicant regarding disclosure, foreign filing, and other activities. The applicant is notified of the secrecy order and is required to acknowledge receipt. Importantly, the secrecy order can be imposed at any time during the pendency of the application, including after an initial foreign filing license has been granted. When a secrecy order is imposed, 37 C.F.R. 5.2 provides that any previously granted foreign filing license is automatically revoked, and the applicant must immediately cease any foreign filing activities related to the subject matter of the application.",

    title: "Types of Secrecy Orders",
    content:
      "There are three types of secrecy orders, each imposing different levels of restriction on the applicant. A Type I Secrecy Order, issued pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.25, permits the applicant to file corresponding patent applications in up to 18 countries that have reciprocal security agreements with the United States. These countries have entered into bilateral or multilateral agreements for the mutual protection of classified inventions. Filing in these reciprocal countries is permitted because the receiving countries have agreed to maintain the secrecy of the invention under their own national security laws. However, no filing is permitted in any country outside of the 18 approved nations, and the applicant must comply with the specific filing procedures outlined in the order. A Type II Secrecy Order is more restrictive than a Type I order. Under a Type II order, the applicant is prohibited from filing any patent application in any foreign country, regardless of whether a reciprocal agreement exists. The invention may still be discussed among individuals who hold appropriate security clearances within the United States, but no foreign disclosure is permitted. A Type III Secrecy Order is the most restrictive category. Under a Type III order, the applicant is prohibited from making any disclosure whatsoever of the subject matter of the invention, whether domestic or foreign. The applicant may not discuss the invention with anyone who does not already have authorized access and an appropriate security clearance. Type III orders are typically reserved for the most sensitive inventions whose mere acknowledgment of existence could be detrimental to national security.",

    title: "Duration, Renewal, and Rescission",
    content:
      "Under 35 U.S.C. 181, a secrecy order is issued for a period of one year. At the end of the one-year period, the head of the interested Government agency must determine whether the secrecy order should be renewed or allowed to expire. If the agency determines that the need for secrecy continues, the order is renewed for an additional one-year period. This renewal process may be repeated annually, and in practice, some secrecy orders remain in effect for many years or even decades if the subject matter continues to implicate national security. Each renewal requires an affirmative determination by the agency head that continued secrecy is warranted. If the agency does not act to renew the order before it expires, the secrecy order lapses and the application returns to normal prosecution. The rescission of a secrecy order occurs when the interested Government agency affirmatively determines that the need for secrecy no longer exists. Upon rescission, the USPTO notifies the applicant, and the application is returned to normal prosecution status. The applicant may then request publication, seek grant of a patent, and file in foreign countries (subject to normal foreign filing license requirements under 35 U.S.C. 184). Additionally, upon rescission of a secrecy order, any foreign filing license that was revoked under 37 C.F.R. 5.2 is not automatically reinstated; the applicant must obtain a new license or rely on the standard automatic license procedures. It is important to note that under 35 U.S.C. 181, the Commissioner has no authority to independently rescind a secrecy order — only the requesting agency can authorize its removal.",

    title: "Related Subject Matter (37 CFR 5.3)",
    content:
      "Under 37 C.F.R. 5.3, the scope of a secrecy order is not limited to the specific application on which it was originally imposed. When an applicant files a new application that contains or discloses substantially the same subject matter as an application already under a secrecy order, the new application is also subject to the same secrecy order. This extension applies automatically by operation of 37 C.F.R. 5.3 and does not require a new determination by the interested Government agency. The purpose of this provision is to prevent applicants from circumventing secrecy orders by filing continuation, continuation-in-part, or divisional applications that contain the restricted subject matter. The rule applies broadly to any application that contains subject matter \"substantially the same\" as that covered by the original secrecy order. This includes not only formal continuation applications under 35 U.S.C. 120 but also any new application — including those filed by different applicants — that discloses substantially the same restricted subject matter. The applicant has an obligation under 37 C.F.R. 5.3 to notify the Licensing and Review section of the USPTO when filing any application that contains subject matter related to an existing secrecy order. Failure to notify the Office may result in additional enforcement actions. The USPTO may also independently identify related applications during the screening process and extend the secrecy order accordingly. The restrictions imposed by the extended secrecy order are the same as those of the original order, including the type of secrecy order (Type I, II, or III) and all associated prohibitions on disclosure and foreign filing.",
