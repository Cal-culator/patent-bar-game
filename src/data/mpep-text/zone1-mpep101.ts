    title: "Confidentiality of Patent Applications",
    content:
      "The confidentiality of patent applications is governed primarily by 35 U.S.C. 122, which establishes the fundamental principle that patent applications shall be kept in confidence by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This confidentiality framework serves two key purposes: protecting the proprietary interests of applicants during the pendency of their applications, and ensuring that the public receives timely access to patent information through the publication system. Under 35 U.S.C. 122(a), the default rule is strict confidentiality — no information concerning a pending application may be given without the authority of the applicant. However, this baseline rule is subject to important exceptions. The most significant exception is the 18-month publication requirement under 35 U.S.C. 122(b), which mandates that most utility and plant patent applications be published 18 months after the earliest filing date. Design patent applications are a notable exception: they are not published at 18 months but instead become public only upon the grant of the design patent. Provisional applications are also never published, because they expire 12 months after filing and cannot mature into a patent on their own. The interplay between confidentiality and publication creates a structured timeline during which applications transition from fully confidential to publicly accessible. Applicants have limited ability to control this timeline through non-publication requests under 35 U.S.C. 122(b)(2)(B), but eligibility for non-publication is restricted. USPTO employees are bound by oath and by criminal statute to maintain the confidentiality of unpublished applications, with violations subject to penalties under 18 U.S.C. 1905.",

    title: "35 USC 122(a) — Basic Confidentiality Rule",
    content:
      "35 U.S.C. 122(a) establishes the baseline confidentiality rule for patent applications: \"Confidentiality of invention. — No information concerning [an application for patent] shall be given without authority of the applicant, to any person not otherwise entitled thereto.\" This provision means that while an application remains pending and unpublished, the USPTO treats its existence and contents as confidential. The Office will not confirm or deny whether an application has been filed, will not disclose the names of applicants or inventors, and will not reveal the subject matter of the application. The phrase \"without authority of the applicant\" is significant because it creates a mechanism by which applicants can authorize the release of information. For example, an applicant may provide a written authorization allowing a specific third party to access the application file. Additionally, certain statutory and regulatory provisions operate as exceptions to the basic confidentiality rule. Under 35 U.S.C. 122(c), the Commissioner may establish regulations for the publication of information concerning published applications, and the Commissioner may make available to the public certain status information under 37 C.F.R. 1.14(e). The confidentiality rule applies to all types of patent applications — utility, design, plant, provisional, and reissue — during the period before publication or grant. Once an application is published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b) or a patent is granted, the application file contents become available to the public under 37 C.F.R. 1.14(a). Applicants should understand that confidentiality under 122(a) is the default starting position, but it is not permanent for applications that proceed to publication or grant.",

    title: "18-Month Publication Under 35 USC 122(b)",
    content:
      "35 U.S.C. 122(b)(1)(A) provides that each application for a patent shall be published promptly after the expiration of a period of 18 months from the earliest filing date for which a benefit is sought under title 35. The earliest filing date includes the filing date of any domestic or international application from which priority or benefit is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121, 365, or 386. The 18-month publication window is calculated from this earliest effective filing date, not from the actual filing date of the application being published. This distinction is critical for exam purposes: if an applicant files a continuation application claiming benefit of an earlier application, the publication clock for the continuation runs from the filing date of the earliest parent application, not from the date the continuation itself was filed. Several categories of applications are exempt from 18-month publication. Design patent applications are never published at 18 months; they are published only upon grant of the design patent. This exemption exists because design patents have a relatively short term and the publication of pending design applications could harm the applicant's commercial interests. Provisional applications are also never published because they automatically expire 12 months after filing and do not themselves mature into patents. Applications subject to a secrecy order under 35 U.S.C. 181 are excluded from publication for as long as the secrecy order remains in effect. Additionally, applications that are no longer pending (i.e., abandoned applications) are not published unless they have been referenced in certain specified ways. Under 37 C.F.R. 1.217, applicants may request that trade secret information be redacted from the published application, though such requests must be filed before the application is published.",

    title: "Non-Publication Requests",
    content:
      "Under 35 U.S.C. 122(b)(2)(B)(i), an applicant may request that the application not be published under the 18-month publication provision, but only if the invention disclosed in the application has not been and will not be the subject of an application filed in a foreign country that requires publication at 18 months, or under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). This eligibility requirement is strict: if the applicant has filed or intends to file a corresponding application in any country or treaty system that publishes at 18 months, the non-publication request is unavailable. A non-publication request must be filed at the time of filing the application or within the time period set by the USPTO. The request is made by certifying that the invention has not been and will not be the subject of a foreign or PCT application that requires 18-month publication. If, after filing a non-publication request, the applicant subsequently files a corresponding application in a foreign country or under the PCT that requires publication, the applicant must notify the USPTO within 45 days of the foreign filing. This 45-day notification requirement under 35 U.S.C. 122(b)(2)(B)(iii) is mandatory, and failure to comply will result in the abandonment of the U.S. application. Upon receipt of the 45-day notification, the USPTO will publish the application in due course. An applicant who has filed a non-publication request may also voluntarily rescind that request at any time by notifying the USPTO. Rescission is irrevocable — once withdrawn, the non-publication request cannot be reinstated, and the application will be published at the earliest opportunity. Non-publication requests are most commonly used by individual inventors or small entities who intend to file only in the United States and wish to maintain confidentiality throughout prosecution.",

    title: "Employee Confidentiality Obligations",
    content:
      "All USPTO employees involved in the examination or processing of patent applications are bound by strict confidentiality obligations. Under 35 U.S.C. 122(a) and the implementing regulations, employees are prohibited from disclosing any information about pending unpublished applications to unauthorized persons. Each USPTO employee must take an oath of office that includes a commitment to maintain the secrecy of patent applications. This oath requirement is codified and reinforced by internal USPTO policies and procedures. The consequences of violating confidentiality obligations are severe. Under 18 U.S.C. 1905, any officer or employee of the United States who publishes, divulges, discloses, or makes known in any manner or to any extent not authorized by law any information coming to the employee in the course of employment that relates to trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association, shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned not more than one year, or both, and shall be removed from office or employment. This criminal provision applies broadly to all forms of unauthorized disclosure, whether intentional or negligent. In addition to criminal penalties, employees who violate confidentiality obligations may be subject to administrative discipline, including termination of employment. The USPTO maintains internal controls and auditing mechanisms to detect unauthorized access to application files. Employees are trained on their confidentiality responsibilities during onboarding and through periodic refresher training. The confidentiality obligation persists even after an employee leaves the USPTO; former employees may not disclose confidential information obtained during their tenure.",
