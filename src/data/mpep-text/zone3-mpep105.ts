    title: "Suspended or Excluded Practitioners",
    content:
      "This section covers the rules and procedures governing interactions with patent practitioners who have been suspended or excluded from practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The Office of Enrollment and Discipline (OED) is responsible for administering the disciplinary process and maintaining the register of practitioners authorized to practice before the Office. When a practitioner is suspended or excluded, specific restrictions apply to both the practitioner and USPTO employees. These restrictions are designed to protect the public, maintain the integrity of the patent system, and ensure that only qualified and authorized individuals practice before the Office. The primary regulatory authority for these restrictions is found in 37 CFR Part 11, with 37 CFR 11.116 establishing the specific communication prohibition. The consequences of violating these restrictions can be severe, including contempt proceedings and referral to law enforcement authorities. Practitioners, applicants, and USPTO employees should all be aware of these rules to ensure compliance.",

    title: "Communication Prohibition: 37 CFR 11.116",
    content:
      "Under 37 CFR 11.116, USPTO employees are strictly prohibited from communicating about pending patent applications with practitioners who have been suspended or excluded from practice before the Office. This prohibition is absolute and applies to all forms of communication, whether oral, written, electronic, or otherwise. The communication ban covers all substantive matters related to pending patent applications, including discussions about office actions, claim amendments, prosecution strategy, or any other aspect of the application.\n\nThe purpose of this prohibition is to prevent suspended or excluded practitioners from continuing to influence the prosecution of patent applications through indirect means. A practitioner who has been disciplined by the OED has been determined to be unfit to practice before the Office, and permitting continued communication would undermine the disciplinary process.\n\nIf a USPTO employee receives a communication from a person they know or have reason to believe is a suspended or excluded practitioner, the employee should immediately terminate the communication and report the contact to the OED. The employee should not provide any information about the application, acknowledge any filing, or engage in any discussion about the merits of the case. This applies even if the suspended practitioner claims to be calling on behalf of the applicant or assignee.",

    title: "Pro Se Exception for Inventors and Applicants",
    content:
      "While suspended and excluded practitioners are generally prohibited from practicing before the USPTO, an important exception exists for those who are themselves inventors or applicants. Under the fundamental principle that any person may prosecute their own patent application, a suspended or excluded practitioner who is the actual inventor or applicant retains the right to file and prosecute their own application pro se — that is, on their own behalf without representation by a registered practitioner.\n\nThis exception is grounded in the statutory right of all individuals to access the patent system for their own inventions. The right to file a patent application is not conditioned on registration as a practitioner. An inventor who happens to have been suspended from practice does not lose this basic right.\n\nHowever, the pro se exception is strictly limited. The suspended or excluded practitioner may only act on their own application where they are the actual inventor or applicant. They may not represent co-inventors, even on the same application. They may not represent assignees, employers, or any other party. They may not hold themselves out as a registered practitioner or use their former registration to suggest that they have special authority. If the suspended practitioner's patent rights have been assigned to another entity, the assignee — not the inventor — controls prosecution under 37 CFR 3.71, and the pro se exception does not override the assignee's authority.",

    title: "OED Role, Discipline, and Consequences of Unauthorized Practice",
    content:
      "The Office of Enrollment and Discipline (OED) plays a central role in maintaining the integrity of patent practice before the USPTO. The OED is responsible for three primary functions: (1) registration of practitioners authorized to practice before the Office, (2) investigation of complaints alleging practitioner misconduct or unauthorized practice, and (3) imposition of disciplinary sanctions when misconduct is found.\n\nThe OED maintains and publishes a roster of practitioners who have been suspended, excluded, or who have resigned in lieu of discipline. This roster is publicly available on the OED website, allowing applicants, assignees, and other practitioners to verify the status of any individual claiming to be authorized to practice before the USPTO.\n\nDisciplinary sanctions available to the OED include reprimand (a formal censure with no practice restriction), probation (continued practice under specified conditions), suspension (temporary bar from practice for a specified period), and exclusion (permanent bar from practice before the Office). The OED publishes its disciplinary decisions to promote transparency and serve as a deterrent.\n\nWhen a suspended or excluded practitioner engages in unauthorized practice, the consequences can include OED investigation of the unauthorized activity, initiation of contempt proceedings if a court order is involved, referral to appropriate federal or state law enforcement authorities for possible criminal prosecution, and extension of the suspension period or conversion to permanent exclusion. The OED takes unauthorized practice seriously as it threatens the integrity of the patent system and the interests of applicants who may be harmed by unqualified representation.",
