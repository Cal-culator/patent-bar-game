    title: "National Security Review of Patent Applications",
    content:
      "Under 35 U.S.C. 181, patent applications filed at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) are subject to national security screening before substantive examination begins. This screening process serves to identify inventions whose publication or disclosure could be detrimental to national security. The national security review is a critical gatekeeping function that occurs early in prosecution and must be completed before an application can be assigned to an examiner for substantive examination. The screening process involves multiple defense and government agencies, each reviewing applications within their respective areas of authority. The three primary screening functions are: (1) secrecy order determination — evaluating whether disclosure of the invention would be detrimental to national security, warranting a secrecy order under 35 U.S.C. 181; (2) export control review — assessing whether the invention has export control implications; and (3) government property interest assessment — determining whether the United States Government has a property interest in the invention, such as through a government contract or funding agreement. The Licensing and Review (L&R) division of the USPTO serves as the central processing unit for national security matters, coordinating the screening process, handling classified applications, and assigning L&R codes that track the screening status of each application. Applications containing classified information must be hand-carried to the L&R division and cannot be filed electronically.",

    title: "Screening Authority and Three Screening Functions",
    content:
      "The authority for national security screening of patent applications originates from 35 U.S.C. 181, which provides that whenever the publication or disclosure of an invention would be detrimental to national security, the Commissioner shall order that the invention be kept secret. The screening process is carried out by interested government agencies, each operating within its statutory mandate. Defense agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Security Agency (NSA), screen applications for military significance — inventions whose disclosure could compromise military capabilities or national defense. The Department of Energy (DOE) screens applications related to atomic energy under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 2182. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) screens applications involving space technology under 51 U.S.C. 20135. The three screening functions performed during national security review are distinct but complementary. First, the secrecy order screening determines whether the invention warrants classification and restriction under a secrecy order to prevent disclosure detrimental to national security. Second, the export control screening evaluates whether the invention has implications under export control regulations that restrict the transfer of defense-related and dual-use technologies to foreign nationals or foreign countries. Third, the government property interest screening assesses whether the United States Government may have a property interest in the invention, typically arising when the invention was developed under a government contract, grant, or cooperative agreement. Each screening function serves a different policy objective, but all three are conducted as part of the integrated national security review process.",

    title: "Filing Classified Patent Applications",
    content:
      "Patent applications containing classified information are subject to special filing requirements that differ significantly from standard application procedures. Classified applications must be hand-carried to the Licensing and Review (L&R) division of the USPTO by an individual who holds the appropriate security clearance. Electronic filing through EFS-Web or any other electronic system is strictly prohibited for classified material because electronic filing systems are not approved for the transmission of classified information. The hand-carry requirement ensures that classified documents are transported securely and delivered directly to cleared personnel within the L&R division. When a classified application is received by L&R, the division verifies the security markings, confirms the clearance of the delivering individual, and initiates the intake process. The L&R division maintains secure storage facilities — including locked safes and security containers — for housing classified application files. All handling, storage, and processing of classified applications must comply with applicable government security regulations. The L&R division also coordinates with the originating defense agency to ensure that the classified material is handled in accordance with the agency's security requirements. Practitioners who prepare and file classified patent applications must themselves hold security clearances at or above the classification level of the material. The L&R division serves as the single point of entry for all classified patent applications, ensuring that proper security protocols are maintained from the moment of filing through the completion of prosecution.",

    title: "Security Clearance Requirements",
    content:
      "Patent practitioners who handle classified patent applications must hold individual security clearances issued by the federal government. The security clearance requirement is personal to each practitioner — registration as a patent agent or patent attorney before the USPTO does not confer any security clearance or authorization to access classified material. The clearance level held by a practitioner must be at or above the classification level of the material being handled. For example, a practitioner working on an application classified at the 'Secret' level must hold a 'Secret' clearance or higher (such as 'Top Secret'). A practitioner with only a 'Confidential' clearance may not access 'Secret' or 'Top Secret' material. The standard classification levels, in ascending order of sensitivity, are Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. Some applications may also require access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or Special Access Programs (SAP), which impose additional access controls beyond the standard clearance levels. A law firm or organization that handles classified patent work must typically hold a facility security clearance in addition to the individual clearances of its practitioners. However, a facility clearance alone does not authorize any individual to access classified material — each person who will access the classified application must independently hold the appropriate personal clearance. The security clearance process involves a background investigation conducted by a federal agency and can take several months to complete. Practitioners who anticipate handling classified patent work should initiate the clearance process well in advance.",

    title: "L&R Codes and Processing",
    content:
      "The Licensing and Review (L&R) division assigns L&R codes to patent applications to track their national security screening status throughout the review process. These codes serve as procedural markers that indicate where an application stands in the screening pipeline — whether screening is pending, in progress with one or more defense agencies, or has been completed. The L&R code system is essential for managing the workflow of applications subject to national security review and ensures that no application proceeds to substantive examination before screening is complete. When an application is first received or identified for screening, L&R assigns an initial code indicating that the application is awaiting review. As the application is forwarded to the relevant screening agencies — which may include DoD, DOE, NASA, or other interested agencies — the code is updated to reflect that screening is in progress. The screening timeline varies depending on several factors, including the complexity of the subject matter, the number of agencies that need to review the application, and the current workload of the screening agencies. There is no fixed statutory deadline for completing national security screening. Once all screening agencies have completed their review and provided their determinations, the L&R code is updated to reflect the outcome. If no secrecy order is recommended, the code indicates that screening is complete and the application is cleared to proceed to substantive examination in the normal course. If a secrecy order is recommended by any agency, the Commissioner imposes the secrecy order and the L&R code reflects the application's classified status. The L&R code remains associated with the application throughout its pendency, providing a continuous record of the application's national security screening history.",

    title: "Agency-Specific Screening",
    content:
      "Each government agency involved in national security screening of patent applications has a distinct area of responsibility defined by its statutory mandate. The Department of Defense (DoD) and its components, including the National Security Agency (NSA), screen patent applications for military significance. DoD evaluates whether the disclosure of an invention could compromise military capabilities, defense systems, intelligence gathering, or national security operations. NSA, as a component of DoD, has particular expertise in screening applications related to cryptography, signals intelligence, and communications security. The Department of Energy (DOE) screens patent applications for implications related to atomic energy under 42 U.S.C. 2182. This includes inventions involving nuclear materials, nuclear reactors, nuclear weapons technology, uranium enrichment, and other technologies within the scope of the Atomic Energy Act. DOE's screening authority is critical because atomic energy technology has both civilian and military applications, and improper disclosure could have severe national security consequences. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) screens patent applications for space technology implications under 51 U.S.C. 20135. NASA evaluates inventions relating to spacecraft, satellite systems, launch vehicles, propulsion systems, and other aeronautics and space technologies. NASA's screening also serves to identify inventions in which the government may have a property interest, particularly when the technology was developed under a NASA contract or cooperative agreement. When a patent application contains subject matter relevant to multiple agencies, each agency independently screens the application within its own area of authority. A single application may be reviewed by DoD, DOE, and NASA simultaneously, and any one agency's determination that disclosure would be detrimental to national security is sufficient to trigger a secrecy order.",
