    title: "Examination of Applications Under Secrecy Order",
    content:
      "Patent applications that are subject to a secrecy order under 35 U.S.C. 181 continue to be examined on their merits notwithstanding the imposition of the secrecy order. The existence of a secrecy order does not suspend or terminate the examination process; rather, the application proceeds through substantive examination in the same manner as any other patent application, with certain important procedural modifications necessitated by the secrecy requirements. Examiners assigned to secrecy order cases must hold the appropriate security clearance for the classification level of the application and must handle the application materials in accordance with the security procedures prescribed for that classification level. The examination of secrecy order applications includes the same prior art search, analysis of patentability under 35 U.S.C. 101, 102, 103, and 112, and issuance of office actions as would occur in any other application. However, because the application is under a secrecy order, it will not be published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b) and no patent will be granted while the secrecy order remains in effect. If the application is found to be in condition for allowance, the application will be held in a \"ready for issue\" status until the secrecy order is rescinded. Once the secrecy order is lifted, the patent may be granted in the normal course. The applicant retains the right to prosecute the application, respond to office actions, file amendments, and pursue continuation or divisional applications, all subject to the security handling requirements and the restrictions of the secrecy order.",

    title: "Prosecution Procedures Under Secrecy",
    content:
      "The prosecution of applications under secrecy order follows the standard USPTO examination procedures with several notable exceptions and restrictions. First, the application will not be published under the 18-month publication provisions of 35 U.S.C. 122(b). The secrecy order effectively overrides the publication requirement, and the application remains unpublished for as long as the secrecy order is in effect. This means that the applicant cannot benefit from provisional rights under 35 U.S.C. 154(d), which require publication. Second, interference proceedings under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 135 (or derivation proceedings under AIA 35 U.S.C. 135) involving secrecy order applications are handled with special restrictions. Where both applications in a potential interference are under secrecy orders, the interference may proceed under secure conditions. However, where only one application is under a secrecy order, the interference is typically suspended until the secrecy order is rescinded to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the classified subject matter. Third, inter partes review (IPR), post-grant review (PGR), and other post-issuance proceedings at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) are not available while the application is under a secrecy order because no patent has been granted. Fourth, the applicant may not cite or reference the secrecy order application in other non-classified applications in a manner that would disclose the classified subject matter. Any cross-references, priority claims, or incorporation-by-reference statements must be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not violate the terms of the secrecy order. All prosecution correspondence must be transmitted through secure channels as required by the classification level of the application.",

    title: "Appeals and Compensation",
    content:
      "Applicants whose applications are subject to secrecy orders have limited but significant rights regarding appeals and compensation. With respect to appeals, an applicant may appeal adverse patentability determinations to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) under 35 U.S.C. 134, even while a secrecy order is in effect. However, the appeal proceedings must be conducted under secure conditions appropriate to the classification level of the application, and the resulting decisions are not publicly available. Judicial review of PTAB decisions in secrecy order cases is restricted. The applicant generally may not appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or institute a civil action under 35 U.S.C. 145 while the secrecy order remains in effect, because doing so would require public disclosure of the classified subject matter in court filings and proceedings. With respect to compensation, 35 U.S.C. 183 provides that an applicant whose patent is withheld due to a secrecy order may apply to the head of the Government agency that caused the secrecy order to be issued for compensation for the damage caused by the order and for the use of the invention by the Government. The applicant must file the compensation claim within six years after the secrecy order is rescinded. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the agency's determination on compensation, the applicant may bring a suit against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims under 35 U.S.C. 183. The Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to award reasonable compensation, including a reasonable royalty, for the Government's use of the invention during the period the secrecy order was in effect. Compensation under 35 U.S.C. 183 is the exclusive remedy available to applicants for damages caused by secrecy orders; no other cause of action lies against the Government for withholding a patent under a secrecy order.",
