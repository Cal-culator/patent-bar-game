    title: "Power to Inspect Patent Files",
    content:
      "This section covers the rules governing who has the authority to inspect patent application files at the USPTO, particularly for applications that have not yet been published. Under 37 C.F.R. 1.14, the power to inspect patent files varies depending on the publication status of the application and the identity of the person requesting access. For published applications and granted patents, the file is open to the public under 37 C.F.R. 1.11. For unpublished pending applications, access is restricted to the applicant, the attorney or agent of record, and persons with written authorization. The regulation also provides for public access to limited status information and establishes a petition process for accessing unpublished abandoned applications. MPEP Section 104 provides guidance to examiners and practitioners on how these access rules are applied in practice, including the requirements for demonstrating authorization and the procedures for filing and evaluating access petitions.",

    title: "Access to Unpublished Pending Applications: 37 CFR 1.14(c)",
    content:
      "Under 37 C.F.R. 1.14(c), access to unpublished pending patent applications is limited to specific authorized persons. The applicant (which may be the inventor, assignee, or obligated assignee) has an inherent right to inspect their own application at any time. The attorney or agent of record — meaning the practitioner who has been formally recognized by the USPTO as representing the applicant in that specific application — also has full access to the file.\n\nOther persons may obtain access to an unpublished pending application only with written authorization from the applicant or the attorney or agent of record. This written authorization must specifically identify the application and the person being authorized. A registered patent attorney who is not the attorney of record cannot access the file merely by virtue of their registration with the USPTO. They must present written authorization from an authorized party.\n\nIn practice, authorized access to unpublished applications is typically exercised through Patent Center's authenticated portal, where the applicant or attorney of record can log in with their USPTO.gov credentials. To grant access to others, the applicant or attorney of record may file a power of attorney or a written authorization letter identifying the person to be given access. The USPTO will verify authorization before providing access to unpublished files. This restriction protects the confidentiality of pending applications and prevents unauthorized disclosure of potentially valuable intellectual property.",

    title: "Status Information Available to the Public: 37 CFR 1.14(e)",
    content:
      "Under 37 C.F.R. 1.14(e), certain limited status information about patent applications is available to any member of the public upon request. Specifically, the USPTO will confirm whether a particular application (identified by serial number) is pending, abandoned, or has resulted in a patent. This provision recognizes that while the substantive contents of unpublished applications must be kept confidential under 35 U.S.C. 122(a), there is a legitimate public interest in knowing the basic status of applications in the patent system.\n\nThe scope of information available under 37 C.F.R. 1.14(e) is intentionally narrow. The Office will provide only the three status categories: pending, abandoned, or patented. For unpublished applications, the Office will not disclose the title of the invention, the names of the inventors, the filing date, the assignee, or any substantive content of the application. These details become publicly available only upon publication under 35 U.S.C. 122(b) or upon patent grant.\n\nPractitioners should be aware that the availability of status information means competitors can determine whether a known application serial number is still active. This has strategic implications for patent prosecution, as competitors may monitor the status of pending applications. However, the limited nature of the information (status only) means that the substantive content and prosecution history remain protected until publication or grant.",

    title: "Access to Unpublished Abandoned Applications and Provisionals: 37 CFR 1.14(i)",
    content:
      "Under 37 C.F.R. 1.14(i), access to unpublished abandoned patent applications may be obtained by petition. This provision addresses the situation where an application has been abandoned before publication, leaving it in a state where it is neither publicly available nor actively pending. Without this provision, unpublished abandoned applications would be permanently inaccessible to the public, even when there is a legitimate need to review their contents.\n\nTo obtain access under 37 C.F.R. 1.14(i), the petitioner must demonstrate that the unpublished abandoned application is relied upon as a reference in a pending proceeding or has been identified in a published document. For example, if an examiner cites an unpublished abandoned application as prior art in rejecting claims of another application, the applicant of the rejected application may petition for access to review the cited reference. Similarly, if a published patent or application cross-references an unpublished abandoned application, a party with a need to understand the cross-referenced material may petition for access.\n\nProvisional applications present a special case. Provisional applications are not published by the USPTO and do not become publicly available upon expiration. However, when a provisional application is relied upon as a priority basis in a subsequently published non-provisional application or an issued patent, the provisional may become accessible to the public under 37 C.F.R. 1.14(a). This ensures that the public can review the priority document when it forms the basis for claimed priority in a publicly available patent or application.",

    title: "FOIA, Patent Files, and Special Access Considerations",
    content:
      "The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), codified at 5 U.S.C. 552, generally requires federal agencies to make records available to the public upon request. However, the relationship between FOIA and patent application files is governed by the specific confidentiality provisions of 35 U.S.C. 122, which take precedence over FOIA's general disclosure requirements for unpublished patent applications.\n\nUnder 35 U.S.C. 122(a), applications for patents shall be kept in confidence by the Office. This statutory mandate creates an exemption from FOIA for unpublished patent application files. A FOIA request cannot be used to compel the USPTO to disclose the contents of an unpublished patent application, because the patent statute specifically prohibits such disclosure. The FOIA exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) — which exempts records specifically protected by another statute — applies to patent application files protected by 35 U.S.C. 122.\n\nHowever, FOIA does apply to other USPTO records that are not patent application files. Non-application records such as internal administrative documents, policy memoranda, examination guidance materials, organizational records, correspondence about patent policy, and statistical data about patent processing are subject to FOIA. The public may submit FOIA requests for these types of records through the USPTO's FOIA office. Practitioners and the public should understand the distinction between patent application files (protected by 35 U.S.C. 122) and general administrative records (subject to FOIA) when seeking information from the USPTO.",
